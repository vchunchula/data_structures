# data_structures
  Based on examples and concepts from Robert Sedgewick's Algorithms in C++
  
  1. Quick find eager approach
  2. Quick find Lazy approach with weighting
        
| Algorithm | Initialize | Union | Connected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quick-find-Eager | N | N | 1 |
| quick-union-Lazy | N | N<sup>t</sup> | N |
| weighted QU | N | lg N<sup>t</sup> | lg N |
